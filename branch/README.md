## 🚀 About this project

In Brazil, most older people have the habit of sending images with beautiful backgrounds and inspiring phrases in the morning to their friends and family.
Thinking about this demand I created a super simple and intuitive application for all ages that automates this process and gives much more freedom to those who like these images to create a unique image.

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Technologies 

<ul>
  <li> Flutter </li> 
  <li> Dart </li>
</ul>

I used Flutter to develop the application and consumed an API to generate the quotes and another to generate the background images.

The user has the freedom to always generate new images with a new combination of text and background. And even edit the sentence, if you want to send something personalized. And so, share with your friends on social networks.
